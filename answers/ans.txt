1. How will you analyze this data for cleanliness? 
	Mainly data cleanliness could be checked via three methods

	1> Data not available: Nan values
		In the time series given it might be possible that values are not at all recorded at particular timestamp
		for single or group of serieses. Values are not recorded, though they were present, so these values can
		not be replaced by 0 or any default value.

	2> Data has impossible/out of range values
		The given time series is represents incrimental difference between two readings taken at the timestamp.
		The difference could be +ve or -ve value, but there is certain range between which we will have values. 
		If the value recorded , difference between two successive reading, is lying out of range then it could
		be wrong reading. Spikes and deeps, when plotted graph, in the data represent such impossible values
	
	3> Data is in inconsitent format.
		Time series values difference is in floating format, strictly numeric format. If the values recorded 
		have any alphanumeric value, then it might be possible that we are looking at totally wrong observation.

a. Apply your suggestions to this data and describe ways in which it is not clean.
